            <p class="text-2xl font-semibold px-5 text-start mt-5">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</p>

        <p class="text-xl px-5 text-start">
            While let and const are block-scoped, var declarations are either globally scoped or function-scoped. Let variables can be updated but not re-declared, const variables cannot be updated or re-declared, and var variables may both be updated and re-declared inside their scope.
        </p>

        <p class="text-2xl font-semibold px-5 text-start mt-5">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</p>

        <p class="text-xl px-5 text-start">
            Null is basically an assignment value. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value and is empty. Undefined is when we declare a variable but do not assign a value to it(define it), the variable becomes undefined. Null is a type of object.

        <p class="text-2xl font-semibold px-5 text-start mt-5">What do you mean by REST API?</p>

        <p class="text-xl px-5 text-start">
            A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.
